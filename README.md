<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This project simulates small-niche evolution between two competing factions of a species. One is dubbed the chaser agent, and aggresively seeks food, whereas the other, the wandering agent, roams freely due to its ability to harvest food with greater ease. In the simulation of reproduction between "rounds", or generations, a system that facilitates interbreeding and mutations is also in place. </p>
